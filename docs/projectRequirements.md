# ECGscan - Project Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
Our project, **ECGScan**, is designed to act as an ECG report scanner that analyzes printed ECG reports, matches them with similar cases, and provides corresponding conclusions. By using similarity detection technology, the system can offer a probability-based diagnosis. This diagnosis is presented through a report that indicates how closely a given ECG matches a specific condition, along with a confidence level. Additionally, the app provides a list of potential medical conditions with confidence scores, helping users interpret their results more effectively. Metadata, including heart rate and waveform characteristics, is extracted to give a comprehensive overview of the scan.

ECGScan is particularly valuable in settings where only printed ECG reports are available, serving as a rapid assessment tool to support triage system decisions. By quickly identifying whether a case is potentially critical, ECGScan can enhance efficiency, particularly in environments where resources are limited. The user interface (UI) is designed to be simple and intuitive, ensuring accessibility for a wide range of users, including non-English speakers.

### How the App Works:
1. The user **scans an ECG report** (via photo or upload).
2. The app **processes the image** and runs it through a **matching algorithm**.
3. It returns **similar diagnoses** along with the **confidence level**.


## Project Overview
### Problem Statement
- Many **medical facilities rely on paper ECG reports**, making it difficult to leverage modern AI-driven diagnostic tools.
- Quick **triage decisions** are essential, especially in high-volume or resource-limited settings.

### Value Proposition
- Provides **automated analysis** of ECG reports.
- Assists **triage nurses and doctors** in **prioritizing patients**.
- **Works offline**, making it useful in **low-resource settings**.

### Target Users
- **Doctors, nurses, and medical professionals** in clinics, hospitals, and field settings.
- **Medical researchers** interested in ECG analysis trends.
- **Non-English speakers** who need a simple and intuitive tool.

### Usage
- Users **scan/upload** an ECG report.
- The app **analyzes and matches** the report with existing data.
- The user receives **similar cases and potential diagnoses**.

## Project Glossary
- **ECG (Electrocardiogram)**: A test that records the electrical activity of the heart.
- **Triage**: The process of determining the priority of patients' treatments based on the severity of their condition.
- **Confidence Level**: A probability measure indicating how certain the system is about a particular diagnosis.
- **Waveform Analysis**: The study of ECG signal patterns to detect abnormalities.

## User Stories
User stories are formulated using the standard notation:
> *As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].*

### Sample User Stories:
1. **As a doctor**, I want to scan an ECG report, so that I can receive an automated diagnosis suggestion.
2. **As a nurse**, I want a confidence score for each suggested diagnosis, so that I can prioritize critical patients.
3. **As a non-English speaking healthcare worker**, I want a simple and intuitive UI, so that I can use the app without language barriers.

All other user stories can be found under the Issues tab on Github.

### Acceptance Tests:
- The app **correctly identifies** key ECG waveforms from uploaded images.
- The confidence score is **accurate within an acceptable range**.
- The UI is **usable without needing extensive training**.

### MoSCoW Prioritization:
- **Must Have**: Image processing, ECG pattern matching, confidence score.
- **Should Have**: Localization for non-English users.
- **Could Have**: Integration with existing EMR systems.
- **Wonâ€™t Have**: Real-time ECG signal acquisition (initially).
