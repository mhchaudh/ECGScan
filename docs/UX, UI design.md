# UI Design Principles and Usability Heuristics Applied

## **1\. Match Between the System and the Real World**

The web app uses universal symbols and simple words throughout, ensuring that users can easily understand and navigate the interface without confusion. This aligns with real-world expectations and common digital interactions.

## **2\. User Control and Freedom**

Users can retake the ECG image or select a different image within the web app. Additionally, they can quickly return to the home page by pressing the logo in the top left corner or using the dropdown menu in the top right. These features provide flexibility and prevent users from feeling stuck in unwanted actions.

## **3\. Error Prevention**

After clicking confirm, a confirmation option allows users to double-check their actions before proceeding. This reduces the likelihood of accidental errors and enhances the reliability of interactions.

## **4\. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**

The application adheres to a highly aesthetic and minimalist design as per the client's requirements. This ensures a clean, distraction-free interface that enhances usability and focus.

## **5\. Help and Documentation**

An "About Us" documentation section is available, providing users with relevant information about the application. This ensures that users can easily access support materials when needed.

# Accessibility Considerations

## **1\. Color Contrast Compliance**

* The web appâ€™s design follows accessibility guidelines, ensuring adequate contrast. The background is white with black text, while the top bar is \#2596be. The buttons are blue and green, with a red heart logo, ensuring clear visibility.

## **2\. Keyboard Navigation**

* The web app supports keyboard navigation, allowing users to navigate using the tab key.

## **3\. Scalable Text & Responsive Design**

* Users can zoom in for better readability without breaking the layout.  
* The app is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices.

## **4\. Clear and Simple Language**

* The interface uses simple, clear language and universal icons, reducing cognitive load and enhancing usability for all users.
