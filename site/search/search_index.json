This can include: - A similarity score (e.g., \"This ECG report matches X diagnosis with 85% probability\"). - A list of possible medical conditions with confidence levels. - Metadata including heart rate and waveforms.</p> <p>This app is intended for environments where only paper ECG reports are available and can support the triage system by quickly identifying whether a patient\u2019s case is potentially critical. The user interface (UI) will be simple and efficient, making it accessible even to non-English speakers.</p>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#how-the-app-works","title":"How the App Works:","text":"<ol> <li>The user scans an ECG report (via photo or upload).</li> <li>The app processes the image and runs it through a matching algorithm.</li> <li>It returns similar diagnoses along with the confidence level.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#project-overview","title":"Project Overview","text":""},{"location":"projectRequirements/#problem-statement","title":"Problem Statement","text":"<ul> <li>Many medical facilities rely on paper ECG reports, making it difficult to leverage modern AI-driven diagnostic tools.</li> <li>Quick triage decisions are essential, especially in high-volume or resource-limited settings.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#value-proposition","title":"Value Proposition","text":"<ul> <li>Provides automated analysis of ECG reports.</li> <li>Assists triage nurses and doctors in prioritizing patients.</li> <li>Works offline, making it useful in low-resource settings.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#target-users","title":"Target Users","text":"<ul> <li>Doctors, nurses, and medical professionals in clinics, hospitals, and field settings.</li> <li>Medical researchers interested in ECG analysis trends.</li> <li>Non-English speakers who need a simple and intuitive tool.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#usage","title":"Usage","text":"<ul> <li>Users scan/upload an ECG report.</li> <li>The app analyzes and matches the report with existing data.</li> <li>The user receives similar cases and potential diagnoses.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#project-glossary","title":"Project Glossary","text":"<ul> <li>ECG (Electrocardiogram): A test that records the electrical activity of the heart.</li> <li>Triage: The process of determining the priority of patients' treatments based on the severity of their condition.</li> <li>Confidence Level: A probability measure indicating how certain the system is about a particular diagnosis.</li> <li>Waveform Analysis: The study of ECG signal patterns to detect abnormalities.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#user-stories","title":"User Stories","text":"<p>User stories are formulated using the standard notation:</p> <p>As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].</p>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#sample-user-stories","title":"Sample User Stories:","text":"<ol> <li>As a doctor, I want to scan an ECG report, so that I can receive an automated diagnosis suggestion.</li> <li>As a nurse, I want a confidence score for each suggested diagnosis, so that I can prioritize critical patients.</li> <li>As a non-English speaking healthcare worker, I want a simple and intuitive UI, so that I can use the app without language barriers.</li> </ol> <p>All other user stories can be found under the Issues tab on Github.</p>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#acceptance-tests","title":"Acceptance Tests:","text":"<ul> <li>The app correctly identifies key ECG waveforms from uploaded images.</li> <li>The confidence score is accurate within an acceptable range.</li> <li>The UI is usable without needing extensive training.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#moscow-prioritization","title":"MoSCoW Prioritization:","text":"<ul> <li>Must Have: Image processing, ECG pattern matching, confidence score.</li> <li>Should Have: Localization for non-English users.</li> <li>Could Have: Integration with existing EMR systems.</li> <li>Won\u2019t Have: Real-time ECG signal acquisition (initially).</li> </ul>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#similar-products","title":"Similar Products","text":""},{"location":"projectRequirements/#competitive-products","title":"Competitive Products","text":"<ol> <li>AcqKnowledge by BIOPAC (Site)</li> <li>PMcardio by Powerful Medical (Site)</li> <li>ECG Buddy (Site)</li> </ol>"},{"location":"projectRequirements/#open-source-references","title":"Open-Source References","text":"<ul> <li>BioSig Project (Site) -
